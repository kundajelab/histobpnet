This is forked from [https://github.com/kundajelab/chrombpnet-pytorch](https://github.com/kundajelab/chrombpnet-pytorch) but not meant to remain fully in sync with the original repository. Instead, it serves as a starting point for a different project with its own goals and direction. Every once in a while, changes from the original repository may be merged in if they align with the new project's objectives. I attempt to log these in a changelog (fork_sync.md).
